# Summary
Yo are in charge of writing software for an elevator (lift) company.
Your task is to write a program to control the travel of a lift for a 10 storey building.
A passenger can summon the lift to go up or down from any floor, once in the lift they can choose the floor theyâ€™d like to travel to.
Your program needs to plan the optimal set of instructions for the lift to travel, stop, and open its doors.

## Instructions 
    - Install Rust `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
    Visit https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started for further instructions

    - Clone repo

    - cargo run: for default operation

    - cargo test: run all unit tests

## Requirements
    - An Elevator should be capable of traversing each floor of a 10 storey build.
    - The elevator can be summoned by a passenger to go either up or down, from any floor, with the exception of down on the first floor.
    - The passenger can select the destination floor once inside the lift.
    - The lift system should pickup and deliver passengers optimally.

## Assumptions
    - Multiple passengers can engage with the lift system at one time, on the same and different floors.
    - Only one lift operates at a time (single lift track)
    - A passenger may stop at other floors before arriving at their chosen floor according to any other passengers that they may be sharing the lift with.

## Test cases:
    - Scenario 1: Passenger summons lift on the ground floor. Once in, chooses to go to level 5.
    - Scenario 2: Passenger summons lift on level 6 to go down. Passenger on level 4 summons the lift to go down. They both choose L1.

    
    
    - Scenario 3: Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from L2.
                  Passenger 1 chooses to go to L6 
                  Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4.
                  Passenger 2 chooses to go to Ground Floor



    - Scenario 4: Passenger 1 summons lift to go up from Ground. They choose L5. 
                  Passenger 2 summons lift to go down from L4. 
                  Passenger 3 summons lift to go down from L10. 
                  Passengers 2 and 3 choose to travel to Ground.
